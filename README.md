# Music-Genre-Classification-Tool-Using-Machine-Learning
The tool is made to classify different musical genres from audio files which a user will upload. The coding is done in python language. 

In this project we developed a machine learning model to automatically classify different musical genres from audio files. We will classify these audio files using their low-level features of frequency and time domain. For this project we collected a dataset of audio tracks having similar size and similar frequency range. We used K-nearest neighbors algorithm because in various researches it has shown the best results for this problem.
